This is a Sanguino third-party hardware add-on for the Arduino IDE.

To use it either use the Arduino board manager and add the following url: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lauszus/Sanguino/master/package_lauszus_sanguino_index.json> or simply create a folder named hardware inside your sketchbook directory. Now move the Sanguino directory inside that folder. The structure would look like this:

* Arduino/
	* hardware/
		* Sanguino/
			* avr/
			* bootloaders/
			* variants/
			* README.md
			* boards.txt

Since the ATmega1284 is not supported by Avrdude. You will have to burn the bootloader manually from the command line. See this file for help: [ATmega1284.md](bootloaders/optiboot/ATmega1284.md).
